        <h2 class="tip" id="transportation">Public transport in Barcelona</h2>
        <p>Barcelona has a large and well connected network of public transport, including metro, bus, tram, and regional trains*. We think using public transport in Barcelona is the best way for moving around the city, and here you have some tips about it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>General info</b>: public transport in Barcelona is managed by three public companies. <a href="https://www.tmb.cat/en/home">TMB</a> (Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona) handles the network of metro, bus and tram (besides other special means of transportation) in Barcelona and its metropolitan area. Besides, there are two separate train networks, the <b><i>ferrocarrils</i></b> or <a href="https://www.fgc.cat/">FGC</a> (Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya) and <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/es/cercanias/rodalies-catalunya"><b>Rodalies</b> de Catalunya</a>. You can find information about each of these services on their respective websites.</li>
          <li><b>Planning your journey</b>: the whole network of public transport is totally integrated in Google Maps. Besides you can plan your journey on the <a href="https://www.tmb.cat/en/home">TMB's website</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geomobile.tmbmobile&hl=es&gl=US">app</a>. TMB includes information about the <i>ferrocarrils</i> (one of the train networks), although you can search specific information about them on the <a href="https://www.fgc.cat/en/">FGC's website</a>. As for <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/en/suburban/rodalies-catalunya">rodalies</a> (the other train network), you can check different lines and schedules on <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/en/suburban/rodalies-catalunya"></a>their website.</li>
          <li><b>Tickets</b>: <a href="https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona-fares-metro-bus/single-and-integrated/single-ticket">Single tickets</a> for TMB (metro, bus and tram) cost €2.40 (metro tickets to/from the airport cost €5.15). However, there is a series of multi-jorney tickets. The so-called <a href="https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona-fares-metro-bus/single-and-integrated/t-casual"><i>T-casual</i></a> costs €7.95 and includes 10 journeys for metro, bus, tram and both train networks, <i>ferrocarrils</i> and <i>rodalies</i> (for one journey, you can change as many lines and means of transportation as many times as you want within 75 minutes after validating the ticket), excluding metro stations at the airport. Since during SoMoS you will need to go to and return from <a href="#UAB">Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</a>, the T-casual is more economic than 4 single tickets, and you still can use 6 more journeys in the city. Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona is located in Zone 1 of the pricing system. Therefore, <b>we suggest participants to SoMoS to purchase a <i>T-casual</i> ticket for 1 zone</b>. This ticket is individual, you cannot share it with other people, that is, validate it more than once, for the same journey. You can purchase tickets at automatic vending machines in any metro station. You can also purchase and use them through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geomobile.tmbmobile&hl=es&gl=US">TMB's app</a>, although it is known to malfunction quite often. <b>Keep your ticket until exiting the station of your destination!</b> Ticket controls might be just at the exit.</li>
          <!-- <a href="https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona-fares-metro-bus/single-and-integrated/t-casual"><img src="img/T_casual.png" alt="T-casual" style="position: absolute; right: 0; bottom: 0"></a> -->
        </ul>
        <p>*If you walk around the city you will see many stations of public bikes. These bikes are only available to people living in Barcelona though. There are many private companies for bike and scooter rentals, which you can find with an easy search online. </p>

        <h2 class="tip" id="UAB-Graus">How to get to the venue in the UAB</h2>
        <p>The second and third days of the symposium will take place at <a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/universitat-autonoma-de-barcelona-1345467954774.html">Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona</a> (UAB). Its campus is not located in the city of Barcelona, but in a beautiful mountaneous area outside of the neighbouring town of Cerdanyola del Vallès. The venue for SoMoS is the <b>Sala de Graus</b>, at the building of the <b>Facultat de Filosofia i Lletres</b>. To get there from Barcelona we suggest you follow this way:</p>
        <ul>
          <p><b>IMPORTANT: the train travel takes around 34 minutes, and walking from the train station at UAB to the venue takes another 15 minutes, so please, plan your time accordingly!</b></p>
          <li><b>Train to the UAB</b>: the most convenient way to get to the UAB is using the trains known as <a href="https://www.fgc.cat/en/"><i>ferrocarrils</i></a> (not those known as <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/en/suburban/rodalies-catalunya"><i>rodalies</i></a>).
            <ul>
               <li>There are two stations of <i>ferrocarrils</i> in the center of Barcelona: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XqUjyBXJPUMtRy9S9"><b>Catalunya</b></a> (connection with metro lines L1 and L3), or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/nXtbeSpcuj6Qtb2u6"><b>Provença</b></a> (connection with metro lines L3 and L5).</li>
               <li>Take line <b>S2</b> or <b>S6</b> to the station <b>Universitat Autònoma</b>. You can check the time schecule on the <a href="https://www.fgc.cat/en/">FGC's website</a>.</li>
               <li>The station of <b>Universitat Autònoma</b> is in Zone 1 of the pricing system, so you can reach there with the <a href="#transportation">T-casual</a> ticket.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><b>Nice walk through UAB's campus:</b> the UAB has a gorgeous campus among hills, meadows and trees, but getting to the <b>Sala de Graus</b> at the building of the <b>Facultat de Filosofia i Lletres</b> can be a bit tricky. You can follow the path drawn on this map (click to enlarge):</p>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="tip" id="toBarcelona">How to get to Barcelona?</h2>
        <p>Barcelona is a very well connected city and the there are many options to get there:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>By plane</b>: The <a href="https://www.barcelona-airport.com/" target="_blank">Josep Tarradellas Barcelona El Prat Airport (BCN)</a> is the second largest international airport in Spain. It has direct flights to most European countries, and to many other countries around the world. It is well connected to the city of Barcelona by taxi, <a href="https://www.tmb.cat/en/visit-barcelona/public-transport/metro-airport" target="_blank">metro</a> and <a href="https://aerobusbarcelona.es/" target="_blank">bus</a> from the two terminals, and also by <a href="https://www.renfe.com/es/en/suburban/rodalies-catalunya" target="_blank">train</a> from Terminal 2 (you can take a 10 to 15 mins. shuttle bus if you fly to or from Terminal 1).<br>
          Another option would the <a href="https://www.girona-airport.net/" target="_blank">Girona-Costa Brava Airport (GRO)</a>, located in the beautiful city of Girona, and where some low-cost companies fly to. A <a href="https://sagalesairportline.com/" target="_blank">line of buses</a> connects the airport with Barcelona city center in 75 minutes.</li>

          <li><b>By train</b>: If you enjoy land travelling (and saving some carbon emissions!), you might consider the train. Barcelona is <a href="https://www.renfe-sncf.com/" target="_blank">well connected by train</a> with many French cities, from where connections are available to other European cities. It also can be reached by train from Lisbon, changing trains in Madrid. (Pratically all) trains in Spain are managed by the <a href="https://www.renfe.com/" target="_blank">Spanish National Railway Network (Renfe)</a>.</li>

          <li><b>By coach</b>: You can also reach Barcelona by coach, which some times (not always though!) can be the most affordable option. You can get to <a href="https://barcelonanord.barcelona/en/routes" target="_blank">Barcelona Nord Bus Station</a> from France, Italy, Germany, Portugal and other countries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="tip">Where to stay?</h2>
        <p>Barcelona has a huge offer of accommodation options. Here we suggest some options just because of their convenience for accessing the symposium's venues. Barcelona is very well connected with the city's public transport system, so access to the <a href="#UPF">UPF</a> should not be problematic from any location in the Eixample and Sant Martí <a href="https://www.barcelona.cat/en/living-in-bcn/living-neighbourhood" target="_blank">districts</a>. The <a href="#UAB">UAB</a> is located in a neighbouring town, Cerdanyola del Vallès, well connected with trains with Barcelona. There are two railways stations in Barcelona city center, one at Plaça Catalunya and one at Provença, both of them easily accessible from locations in the Eixample <a href="https://www.barcelona.cat/en/living-in-bcn/living-neighbourhood" target="_blank">district</a>. Most of the accommodation options suggested here were selected for being close to either of these stations.</p>
